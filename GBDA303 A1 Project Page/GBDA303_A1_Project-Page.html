        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This project was for my Data and Society course (GBDA303). We were tasked with creating a map and an infographic to demonstrate the relationship between two sets of data. The data had to be retrieved from a reputable source and converted into pivot tables and charts. The project was designed to apply our creative and analytical abilities in a feasible real-world context; we would combine our knowledge of information design and graphic design to effectively communicate our data through the map and infographic.
        </p>
        <p>I chose to analyze two sets of London data from 2022-2023 organized by borough. The first set shows the number and types of crimes committed in London during that period. The second dataset demonstrates the UK government's allocation of funds to Violence Reduction Units (VRUs) across various London boroughs. I selected these datasets to assess whether funds are being allocated to the areas that most need them and whether the allocation is effective.
        </p>
    </section>

        <h1>Insights</h1>
        <p>The map and infographic reveal that VRUs in Croydon, Newham, Brent, Enfield, and Lewisham receive sufficient funding to effectively combat crime in their areas. However, Greenwich's allocation is disproportionate: its VRU receives the same substantial funding as those in Croydon and Newham, despite Greenwich having a significantly lower rate of violent crime. The allocation for Westminster -- the most violent borough -- was very little compared to its extreme rate of violent crime. Even its little allocation does not appear to have been effectively utilized, as Westminster remains the borough with the highest violent crime rate despite being among boroughs with no VRU allocation. Tower Hamlets, Ealing, and Lambeth were allocated zero funds for violence reduction, which is concerning, considering they are among the top 10 boroughs with the highest crime rates.
        </p> 
        <p>Analyzing the datasets reveals an interesting insight that is not represented in the visuals. Of the seven London boroughs with the highest violent crime rates that receive VRU funds, six are overseen by a VRU called the Royal Docks Team; the only borough with a different VRU is Westminster. Unlike the more successfully managed boroughs, the VRU allocation for the most violent borough goes to their City Council. 
        </p>
        <p>Funding VRUs in the 3 currently unprotected London boroughs -- Tower Hamlets, Ealing, and Lambeth -- should be a priority. It would be beneficial to reallocate a portion of the funding that goes to boroughs that are not among the top 10 most violent and therefore have less priority. Reallocating funds from Greenwich is also an option, considering its nearly excessive current allocation; however, reducing funding from what is still one of the most violent boroughs could be risky. It would also be wise to allocate more funds to Westminster, or at least station a Royal Docks Team there, to ensure its VRU allocation is used more effectively. London faces a significant violence problem, which is why the VRUs were created in the first place. By analyzing the data and adjusting allocations, we can ensure that VRU funds are handled thoughtfully and efficiently, optimizing the VRUs’ impact on the problem. 
        </p>

        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <p>In the map, any borough not among the top 10 for violent crime cases is shaded in grey. A spectrum of red is used to represent the amount of funding VRUs received in each borough. This colour was chosen because it is associated with the UK and strength. The number of violent crimes committed in each borough was represented by black, a colour associated with darkness and malice. By layering the colours, the map tells a story about the battle of power between the UK’s VRUs and darkness and crime. Such a polarizing representation is only suitable for data that can universally be considered good or bad like violence; otherwise, the visual could show a bias. The map features a pastel pink background to complement the main data while not drawing too much attention to unwanted areas.
        </p> 
        <p> The infographic follows the same narrative of a power struggle between VRUs and violent crime. I wanted to portray each borough’s statistics as a visual battle between two figures -- strong red against evil black -- as the UK is known for their historical battles. An old parchment background and sword fighting theme were chosen to give the infographic a historical feel, reflective of those battles. 
        </p> 
        <p>The outcome of each borough’s battle is determined by whether funds were allocated effectively enough to the VRU to counter the violent crime rate. The winner is visually represented by a red or black stickman slaying the other and wearing a crown. 
        </p>
        <p>The scale of the stick figures were determined by graphs of the two datasets in proportion to one another. If one statistic significantly trumps the other, it is represented by a giant stick figure crushing a miniscule one. Boroughs with no funding allocated to their VRU are depicted by a black stickman “reigning” uncontested over the area, with no red character in sight. Boroughs with notably lower crime and VRU allocation compared to the top few are portrayed by smaller stick figures.
